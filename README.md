# Searching-the-formula
"The definition of insanity is doing the same thing repeatedly and expecting different results" - Rita Mae Brown. (but probably someone has said this before her, and that's not the definition of insanity either).

I've been trying to have my own company or startup for a long time, and I always fail and consistently fail at the same thing, selling a ready-made product.

I will do it differently this time, not that this way is right or will work, but differently.

I will allocate daily time to carry out the tasks for 50 minutes per weekday from 8:00 pm to 8:50 pm. And two hours on Saturdays and Sundays.

The big difference is that now I will try to sell the project from the beginning.

My main goal is to get to Google Startups. As the project is focused on education, I will take the two Google Educations certifications. Suppose my dream of having a profitable company and contributing to education works out. If it goes wrong, I will have at least two Google certifications and five scientific articles for the Ph.D.

My goals:

1 - Create a solution that uses artificial intelligence for voice recognition, and with that, create a solution with virtual reality, where you can train a new language or train presentations.

2- A game that recognizes academic emotions using image recognition.

3- A Quiz that uses emotion recognition.

Project deadlines:

From today 07/12/2022, until 11/12/2023, which is 423 hours.

I will publish all my advances, errors, and successes (if any) over time weekly.

Let the challenge begin.
